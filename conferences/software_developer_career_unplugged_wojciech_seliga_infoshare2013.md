## Steer your own career
Most of the people let accidents steer their career. They take the nearest opportunities not having a global plan. This may end in a disaster like a finding yourself in a professional dead end. 

Interesting statistics about people in general:

 * 75% watch things happen,
 * 20% wonder why things happen,
 * 5% make things happen.

Most of the people think they are in those 5%. Most of the people are wrong.

## Sigmoid curve
Standard curve of growing skills in a given field - not only IT. When you change an environment - or change a position or start doing things the new way - you face a temporary decline in how well you perform.

Then, there is a rise, which can last even for years. At some point though your pace of development gets smaller and negative eventually.

The trick is to see the turning point coming and move yourself for the next challenege early enough. You want to jump on the next curve.

### Lizard brain
People are animals so they naturally prefer to stay in the comfort zones and don't challenge themselves too much. It takes self-consciousness and will-power to fight this desire.

## Attractive company
The people we work with have a large effect on the steepness of the curve. Things that make a company attractive:

 * Culture
 * Impact / Purpose
 * Opportunity for personal growth
 * Colleagues
 * Money
 * Location
 * Technology

The last three are not important actually. Technologies come and go, you can work remotely and you're not starving as a software developer.

### Culture
Culture is the most important. It is:

 * Beliefs
 * Values - in practice
 * Practices
 * Attitude
 * Openness
 * Executives & Board

Check if the company takes its values seriously. If it says it loves open source - does it contribute? What impact does it have?

Different companies have different cultures - it's important to find the one that is compatible with our beliefs.

### Job titles
Don't mean much. Some companies let people invent their own titles - like they invent avatars. A title is then a shortcut of how a person sees himself.

## Developer vs. manager
Developers often take managing positions for money and hate their jobs. They perform poorly as a result.

If our vision of what we'd like to accomplish is small, then take a developer career. If our vision is big and involves a lot of people - take managerial career.

## People

You need nerds. Geeks are even better, but harder to find.

### Colleagues
You are the average of 5 people you spend the most time with. If you are the most skillful person among those 5, then you actually go backwards. It's best to be the worst guy in the team.

### Senior developer
 * Super-smart
 * Productive
 * Analyzes from different perspectives
 * Gives recommendations
 * Mentoring
 * Gives accurate estimates
 * Creates trust by being hyper-visible
 * Is the guy everyone wants to work with

If you want to be good at something it takes around 10000 hours - 5.5 years if you learn 8h / day. If you work 3h / day it's almost 15 years. Stuff that slows you down - meetings, e-mails, corporate bullshit, methodologies, procrastination, etc.

## Making the change
Salary is prison. People often stay in their dead end because their new job would give them less money in the beginning.

When to change your job? If you stopped growing or lost passion. It's hard to see the turning point by yourself. You need a person you can trust - spouse, a friend - that will tell you.
